# Lunar Lander

In this project, I will train an AI spaceship to land in between two flags on the Moon.

## How will I do this?

I will use Deep Reinforcement Learning to train the AI. If it is on the right track, I will reward it, and if not, it will be punished. It will learn to make the decisions which will give it the most reward.
